# FitGirl Downloader

**FitGirl Downloader** is a web-based project that explores an alternative approach to handling large file downloads through automation.

Traditionally, torrent-based downloads are the most common method for handling large files, but they can be slow, unreliable, or inconvenient depending on network conditions and the number of peers and seeds. This project proposes a different idea: instead of relying on torrents, users can simply paste links into a web interface, and the system automatically extracts all available direct download file links and prepares them for faster, organized downloading.

The focus of the project is on **automation, speed, and usability**. With a clean and visually appealing website, users can submit multiple links at once, track progress in real time, and download all extracted files without manual effort. The tool handles everything behind the scenes, turning a repetitive and time-consuming task into a smooth, one-click workflow.
